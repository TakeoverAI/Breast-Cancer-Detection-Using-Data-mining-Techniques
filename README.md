# Breast Cancer Detection Using Data mining Techniques (RapidMiner)

Breast cancer poses a serious threat to the lives of people and is the second leading cause of the death of women today. Due to the increase in life expectancy, urbanization, and adoption of unknown western lifestyles the incidence of breast cancer is constantly increasing in this developing world. Although there are many treatments to cure breast cancer, these strategies cannot eliminate the majority of cancer that develop in lower and lower-middle class families where breast cancer is diagnosed at a very later stage. 
In order to improve the diagnosis of breast cancer and survival outcome, early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control.
# Dataset

The dataset is taken from (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) or you can directly download from github repository.
The dataset which we have used to perform this research is downloaded from kaggle.com. It consists of a total of 32 attributes consisting of I.D. number, Diagnosis (M= malignant and B= benign) and other 30 real valued input features with a class distribution of 357 benign and 212 malignant cells.
# RapidMiner 

We have used Rapid miner tool to implement below algorithms. RapidMiner is a data science software platform developed by the company of the same name that provides an integrated environment for data preparation, machine learning, deep learning, text mining, and predictive analytics. It is used for business and commercial applications as well as for research, education, training, rapid prototyping, and application development and supports all steps of the machine learning process including data preparation, results visualization, model validation, and optimization. You can download RapidMiner from this link: https://rapidminer.com/

# Mining Algorithm

This research presents a method to detect breast cancer by employing techniques of data mining using RapidMiner Tool .  We carried out an experimental analysis on a dataset to evaluate the performance. The proposed method has produced highly accurate and efficient results when compared to the existing methods.We focus on the dataset of breast cancer and apply four data mining algorithms to predict the most accurate model for the diagnosis of breast cancer. For the purpose of this research, we have used RapidMiner as the software platform and evaluated the dataset using ANN, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and k-NN classification techniques.The experimental results are shown below:

- ## Artificial Neural Network

**By using ANN** **Accuracy**: 97.19%, **Precision (positive class: B)**: 97.07%, **Recall (positive class: B)**: 98.60%

- ## Naive Bayes

**By using Naive Bayes** **Accuracy**: 93.51%, **Precision (positive class: B)**: 93.96%, **Recall(positive class: B)**: 95.80%

- ## Decision Tree

**By using Naive Bayes** **Accuracy**: 92.98%, **Precision (positive class: B)**: 91.60%, **Recall(positive class: B)**: 97.76%

- ## k Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN)

**By using Naive Bayes** **Accuracy**: 90.86%, **Precision (positive class: B)**: 91.78%, **Recall(positive class: B)**: 93.84%

We have tried to analyze the breast cancer data available on kaggle.com with the aim of developing an accurate prediction model using Data mining techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms reduce data transmissions significantly and incur only small constant rounds of data communications. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the supervised algorithm — Artificial Neural Network, which achieves a near-optimal performance under various conditions.
